mongoDB
=======

learning mongoDB by implementing recommendation engine on this NoSQL

There is a script to build a many-to-many relationship case by embedding an array of _id in each entity.
A case Users-Movies database is generated by randomly assign a set o movies to each user,
also keeping track in each document of the movies collection which users have seen it.

it is completely scalable and can be used to test and measure performance of 
recommendation engines.
